      The following is the wording of a printed statement that Neville Chamberlain waved as he stepped off the plane on 30 September, 1938 after the Munich Conference had ended the day before:<br><br>
      "We, the German FÃ¼hrer and Chancellor, and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting today and are agreed in recognizing that the question of Anglo-German relations is of the first importance for our two countries and for Europe.<br><br>
      We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again. We are resolved that the method of consultation shall be the method adopted to deal with any other questions that may concern our two countries, and we are determined to continue our efforts to remove possible sources of difference, and thus to contribute to assure the peace of Europe."<br><br>
      Chamberlain read the above statement in front of 10 Downing St. and said:<br><br>

      "My good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour.<br>
      I believe it is peace for our time... Go home and get a nice quiet sleep."<br>
